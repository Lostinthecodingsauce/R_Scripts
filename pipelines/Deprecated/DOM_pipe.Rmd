## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(cluster)
library(vegan)
library(rfPermute)
library(binom)
library(epitools)
library(car)
library(multcomp)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtern)
library(psych)
library(nortest)
library(reshape2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggfortify)
library(dunn.test)
library(reshape2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
